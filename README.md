#c_utils
This repo includes funtionality that is not included in C by default. As of this
moment it includes a stack and a utility library that implements some
commonly used functions (hence the name). The plan is that this repo will grow
to include some more common datatypes and algorithm implementations.

##Usage
This project only includes source code so that you easily can include it into
you own project. The installation steps could be as follows:

1. Clone repo
2. Extract desired .c and .h - files
3. Include these files into your own project
4. Compile and run

##Documentation
A quite extensive documentation about the functions can be found inside the
respective .h - file.

##Bugs
Please open an issue or create a PQ if you find any bugs
